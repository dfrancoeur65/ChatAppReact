### Running the dual chat app

Made changes to original simple chat app by making the state data structure a little more complex (array of strings => array of objects)

Look inside /src/complete/App-5.js and compare it with /src/App.js



1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
